## Package List

The `Packages` page, in the same fashion of the `Devices` page, exhibit a list with information about the packages inside a specific `Product` the user selected, such as:

- Package Unique Identifier (UID)
- Version
- Supported hardware list
- Status
- Size
- Upload date

Each one of these items help the user find a specific package. To filter more efficiently the packages you can select and associate them by the following items during the search:

- Status of each package can be found depending on the situation for the `Rollout`
  - _Available_: the package is ready to be downloaded
  - _Upload in Progress_: package during the uploaded process
  - _Removed_: packages that were removed from the packages list
  - _Pending Progress_: packages being checked by the server
  - _Packages with Error_: packages that failed the system checksum
- Version for the package
- Supported hardware
