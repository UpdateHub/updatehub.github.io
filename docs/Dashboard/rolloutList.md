## Rollout List

The rollout is the process of deploying a specific version of your software, a `Package`, to a set of `Devices`.

When a new software version for the `Devices` you have on the field is ready to be deployed it´s possible to start the `Rollout`. All the process happens over-the-air (OTA) and can update a great number of `Devices` effortlessly. Besides, as a safe measure the **UpdateHub** will abort the `Rollout` automatically if the failure rate goes over the threshould specified, providing a safe and fast update plan for your necessities.

The `Rollout List` exhibit every `Rollouts` available for the `Product` chosen and a brief information about them, such as name, version, creation, status and progress.
