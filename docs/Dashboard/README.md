## Meet the **updatehub**

Through the dashboard you, as the **updatehub** user, have a rich but simple interface with all the tools required to:

- Create and operate your own `Products`
- Access `Products` from organizations
- Check when new `Packages` are available for updates
- Oversee a fleet of `Devices` on the field
- Deploy updates via an Over-The-Air system running the `Rollouts`

In essence the dashboard allows the oversight over the whole **updatehub** plataform and operations, making it easy to manage any need that you might have.
