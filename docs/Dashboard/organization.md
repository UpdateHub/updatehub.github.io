### Organization

In addition to the `Access Key` created for the user to work individually, the **UpdateHub** grants the possibility of more than one user to have acess to the same `Product`.

Create an `Organization` is simple, as you just need to click on the `+ Create Organization` button and select a name for it. You will be automatically be set as Owner. After the creation of an `Organization` invitations for new members can be easily sent. The invite must contain the user's e-mail and the level of access allowed to him.

There are three users access levels inside the `Organization`, each one with a particular set of permissions:
- Owner - has all the permissions to normally create products, start rollouts and invite other members for the `Organization`;
- Release Manager - limited to manage the rollouts;
- Developer - has the permission to only create the packages.

Each `Organization` will display a list with all of its members, showing their name, e-mail address, access level of permission, and a list with all the pending invites waiting to be answered.
